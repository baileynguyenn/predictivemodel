# predictivemodel
This project explores data-driven techniques to enhance property price assessments. It includes data exploration, cleaning, regression and decision tree model building, evaluation, and comparison. Implemented in R, it provides insights into predictive modeling for real estate.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Initial data analysis to understand the variables influencing property prices.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation.
- **Model Building:** Construction of regression and decision tree models to predict property prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparison of model performance using various metrics to identify the most suitable approach.

## Technology Used

- **R:** For data analysis and model building.
- **R Packages:** `ggplot2`, `caret`, `rpart` for visualization, data manipulation, and modeling.
  
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictivemodel.git

2. Install used R packages:
   ```bash
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "caret", "rpart"))

3. Run the R scripts to explore the data and build predictive models:
   ```bash
   source("script_name.R")
